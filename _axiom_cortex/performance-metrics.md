# Performance Metrics - Axiom Cortex™

Understanding and interpreting performance metrics is crucial for optimizing [cognitive AI evaluation systems](https://teamstation.dev/cognitive-ai-evaluation-systems) in enterprise environments. Axiom Cortex™ provides comprehensive metrics that enable technical teams to make data-driven decisions about AI model performance and optimization strategies.

## Core Metric Categories

### Cognitive Load Metrics

Cognitive load assessment forms the foundation of Axiom Cortex™'s evaluation framework, providing insights into the mental processing requirements of AI models.

#### Cognitive Load Score (CLS)

The primary metric for assessing AI model cognitive complexity, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

**Interpretation Guidelines:**
- **0.0 - 0.3**: Low cognitive load - Simple models with minimal processing requirements
- **0.3 - 0.6**: Moderate cognitive load - Balanced complexity suitable for most applications
- **0.6 - 0.8**: High cognitive load - Complex models requiring optimization consideration
- **0.8 - 1.0**: Very high cognitive load - Models requiring immediate optimization

```json
{
  "cognitive_load_score": 0.73,
  "cognitive_complexity_breakdown": {
    "input_processing": 0.68,
    "model_inference": 0.81,
    "output_generation": 0.42,
    "memory_utilization": 0.76
  },
  "optimization_potential": 0.34
}
```

#### Cognitive Efficiency Index (CEI)

Measures the ratio of useful cognitive output to total cognitive processing resources consumed.

**Formula**: `CEI = (Useful Output Quality × Accuracy) / Total Cognitive Load`

**Benchmarks:**
- **CEI > 0.8**: Highly efficient cognitive processing
- **CEI 0.6-0.8**: Good efficiency with minor optimization opportunities
- **CEI 0.4-0.6**: Moderate efficiency requiring attention
- **CEI < 0.4**: Poor efficiency requiring immediate optimization

### Performance Metrics

#### Response Time Metrics

Critical for understanding system responsiveness in [enterprise AI applications](https://teamstation.dev/enterprise-ai-applications).

```json
{
  "response_times": {
    "p50_ms": 145,
    "p90_ms": 287,
    "p95_ms": 412,
    "p99_ms": 856,
    "average_ms": 189,
    "max_ms": 1247
  },
  "sla_compliance": {
    "target_p95_ms": 500,
    "current_compliance": 0.97,
    "status": "compliant"
  }
}
```

**Performance Targets:**
- **P95 Response Time**: < 500ms for interactive applications
- **P99 Response Time**: < 1000ms for batch processing
- **SLA Compliance**: > 99.5% for production environments

#### Throughput Metrics

Measure system capacity and scalability characteristics.

```json
{
  "throughput": {
    "requests_per_second": 847,
    "evaluations_per_minute": 1263,
    "concurrent_evaluations": 24,
    "peak_capacity": 1500
  },
  "capacity_utilization": {
    "cpu_utilization": 0.68,
    "memory_utilization": 0.72,

  }
}
```

    "regression_tasks": 0.91,
    "natural_language": 0.88,
    "computer_vision": 0.93
  }
}
```

#### Quality Consistency Index (QCI)

Measures the consistency of AI model outputs across different input variations and contexts.

**Calculation Method:**
```python
def calculate_qci(predictions, ground_truth, contexts):
    """
    Calculate Quality Consistency Index
    """
    context_groups = group_by_context(predictions, contexts)
    consistency_scores = []
    
    for context, group_predictions in context_groups.items():
        variance = calculate_prediction_variance(group_predictions)
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(group_predictions, ground_truth)
        consistency_score = accuracy * (1 - variance)
        consistency_scores.append(consistency_score)
    
    return np.mean(consistency_scores)
```
