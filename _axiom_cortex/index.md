# Axiom Cortex™ — Cognitive AI Evaluation (Science Only)

**What it is:** A measurement system that turns interview evidence into **fair, explainable signals** of fit and performance for nearshore engineering roles.

**What it is not:** A public API or vendor toolkit. Axiom Cortex™ runs **inside** the Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™ platform to support hiring and performance decisions—no external integrations.

---

## Why this exists

US teams needed a way to extend into LATAM with **accuracy, speed, and safety**—without bias from accent, grammar, or style. Axiom Cortex™ judges **reasoning content**, not delivery, so CTOs get the best-aligned problem solvers faster.

## Method at a glance

- **Signals (44 total):** psychometrics + NLP covering problem decomposition, constraint handling, debugging strategy, test design, collaboration cues, and code traceability.  
- **Core method:** *semantic chunking in RAG and staged/multi-step prompting* with **language-fairness calibration** (L2-aware scoring that down-weights grammar noise, preserves idea quality).  
- **Guardrails:** **expert review of flags before roll-up**; mapped to **BARS** (Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales = ratings tied to observable behaviors) for clear feedback.  
- **Decision layer:** constrained utility with reliability & fairness gates; outputs include confidence intervals and gate justifications.

## Signal families (overview)

- **Reasoning & decomposition** • **Solution/architecture** • **Code quality** • **Debugging discipline**  
- **Data/API literacy** • **Concurrency & performance** • **Security & reliability cues**  
- **Collaboration signals** • **Language-fair communication** • **Meta-cognition**

## What you get as a CTO

- **Language-fair scoring** that judges the thinking, not the accent.  
- **Explainable rubrics** tied to observable behaviors (BARS).  
- **Speed & accountability:** Time-to-Offer ≈ 9 days; day-one readiness (devices, access, first ticket); quarterly diagnostics with promotion signals L1–L4.
