# Axiom Cortex™ — Cognitive AI Evaluation (Science Only)

**What it is:** A measurement system that turns interview evidence into **fair, explainable** signals of fit and performance for nearshore engineering roles.

**What it is not:** Public API or vendor toolkit. Axiom Cortex™ runs **inside** the Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™ platform to support hiring and performance decisions.

---

## Why it exists

US teams needed a way to extend into LATAM with **accuracy, speed, and safety**—without bias from accent, grammar, or style. Axiom Cortex™ focuses on **reasoning content**, not delivery, so CTOs get the best-aligned problem solvers faster.

---

## How it works (at a glance)

- **Signals (44 total):** psychometrics + NLP features spanning problem decomposition, constraint handling, debugging strategy, test design, collaboration cues, and code traceability.  
- **Method:** *semantic chunking in RAG and staged/multi-step prompting* with **language-fairness calibration** (L2-aware scoring that down-weights grammar noise and preserves idea quality).
- **Guardrails:** **expert review of flags before roll-up**; mapped to **BARS** (Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales = ratings tied to observable behaviors) for clear, actionable feedback.
- **Decision layer:** constrained utility with reliability & fairness gates; outputs include confidence intervals and gate justifications.

## What you get as a CTO

- **Language-fair scoring** that judges the thinking, not the accent.  
- **Explainable rubrics** tied to observable behaviors (BARS).  
- **Faster hiring:** Time-to-Offer ≈ 9 days; **day-one readiness** via the platform (devices, access, first ticket).  
- **Accountability:** quarterly diagnostics and promotion signals across L1–L4.

---

## How it fits the platform (no API exposed)

Axiom Cortex™ is the **Cognitive AI engine** of the **Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™**—the integrated system that hires, equips, secures, and pays LATAM engineers **under one SLA**. There is **no public API**; all usage is internal to the platform’s hiring and performance workflows.
