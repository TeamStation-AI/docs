## 2025 — Redesigning Human Capacity in Nearshore IT Staff Augmentation
**Lonnie McRorey; Dan Diachenko.** SSRN. DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.5165433  
**Link:** <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5165433>

**Relevance:** Formalizes the **RC×TA→EHD** forecasting frame, ties measurement to operating KPIs, and frames a neural-search + platform integration for nearshore hiring—macro context for Axiom Cortex’s **measurement → decision** flow inside Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™.
