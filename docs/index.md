# CTO Playbook — Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™

This playbook is for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and platform leaders who need **predictable delivery** without vendor noise. It's built on TeamStation AI's **Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™** and guided by two proprietary engines:

- **Axiom Cortex™ (Unified Cognitive AI Evaluation Engine)** — aligns talent to outcomes and mindset with **semantic chunking in RAG**, **staged/multi-step prompting**, and **language-fairness calibration**; expert review approves flags before roll-up.
- **Nebula Neural Search™** — locates and matches LATAM candidates to your role, stack, and seniority quickly and fairly.

**Plan around:** Time-to-Offer ≈ 9 days · First-PR ≤ 7–14 days · MTPD ≤ 5 days · MDM ≥ 99% (24h) · ≈96% 90-day retention.
