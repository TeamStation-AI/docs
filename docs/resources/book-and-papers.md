# Book & Papers

Below are the reference PDFs for the playbook. At the moment these are linked to files in the repository's docs/assets directory — you can upload the actual PDF files to docs/assets/ with the same filenames later, or update the links to point to external URLs.

- [CTO Playbook — Executive Summary](../assets/cto-playbook-executive-summary.pdf)
- [Alliance Model — Whitepaper](../assets/alliance-model-whitepaper.pdf)
- [Axiom Cortex Methodology](../assets/axiom-cortex-methodology.pdf)
- [Nearshore IT Co-Pilot Overview](../assets/nearshore-it-co-pilot-overview.pdf)

Notes:
- If you prefer external hosting, replace the ../assets/... links with absolute URLs (https://...).
- If you want the PDFs committed into the repo now, I can add them to docs/assets/ instead of placeholder links — tell me and provide the files.
