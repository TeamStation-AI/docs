# Assets (PDFs)

This folder should contain supporting PDF assets referenced by the docs.

Expected filenames (place PDFs here to enable downloads):
- cto-playbook-executive-summary.pdf
- alliance-model-whitepaper.pdf
- axiom-cortex-methodology.pdf
- nearshore-it-co-pilot-overview.pdf

If you do not want to commit the binary PDFs into the repo, replace the links in docs/resources/book-and-papers.md with external URLs.
