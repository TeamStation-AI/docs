# Axiom Cortex™ — Unified Cognitive AI Evaluation Engine

**Purpose:** align candidates to **your outcomes**, not résumés.

- Maps role → problem statements → observable behaviors (**BARS** baseline).
- Surfaces strengths, gaps, risk flags, mindset-fit to goals.
- Produces shareable evidence: reasoning artifacts, rubrics, summaries.

**How (plain):** semantic chunking in RAG + staged prompting; L2-aware fairness calibration; expert review of flags before roll-up.
