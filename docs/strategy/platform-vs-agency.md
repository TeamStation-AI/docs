# Platform vs. Traditional Agency Models

| Dimension | Platform (Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™) | Traditional Agency |
|---|---|---|
| Contracting | **One SLA**: hiring→onboarding→devices→EOR→performance | Fragmented agreements |
| Evidence | **SSOT** with audit trails, artifacts, device posture | Emails/spreadsheets |
| Evaluation | **Axiom Cortex™** with fairness calibration + expert review | Ad hoc panels; bias unmanaged |
| Matching | **Nebula Neural Search™** tuned to role/stack/level | Recruiter-keyword search |
| Day-1 Readiness | Devices, access, first ticket; **ARR checkpoints** | Often out-of-band |
| Performance | **BARS** + KPIs, promotions L1–L4 | Manager preference |
| Security | **MDM ≥99% (24h)**, **MTPD ≤5 days** | Best effort |
