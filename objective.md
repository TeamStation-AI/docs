### Implementation Principles

#### 1. Accessibility First
Every feature, update, and content addition must prioritize accessibility from the initial design phase. No accessibility retrofittingâ€”build it right from the start.

#### 2. Contract Compliance
All changes must align with governance frameworks defined in consent.yml and maintain compliance with accessibility laws, data protection regulations, and service level agreements.

#### 3. Automation Over Manual Intervention
Systems must operate autonomously to serve users with disabilities effectively. Manual processes should be exceptions, not the norm.

#### 4. Evidence-Based Validation
All claims must be supported by measurable evidence tracked in claims_ledger.json and validated through automated testing.

#### 5. Continuous Improvement
Regular assessment against objectives with iterative improvements based on user feedback, accessibility audits, and performance metrics.
