# PDF Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual PDF content that will be provided by the TeamStation AI team.

The PDF assets are referenced in the CTO Playbook but the actual files will be generated and uploaded separately.

## Assets Directory Structure

This directory contains placeholder PDF files for:
- Executive briefs and presentations
- ROI calculators and financial models  
- Implementation guides and checklists
- Technical architecture documents
- Legal and compliance templates
- Case studies and best practices

The GitHub Actions workflow creates empty placeholder files for all referenced PDFs during deployment.
