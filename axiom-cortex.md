# Axiom Cortex™ — Cognitive AI Evaluation (Science Only)

**What it is.** A measurement system that turns interview evidence into **fair, explainable signals** of fit and performance for nearshore engineering roles.

**What it is not.** A public API or vendor toolkit. Axiom Cortex™ runs **inside** the Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™ platform—no external integrations.

---

## Why we built it

US teams needed LATAM expansion that is **accurate, fast, and safe**—without bias from accent, grammar, or style. Axiom Cortex™ evaluates **reasoning content**, not delivery, so CTOs get the best-aligned problem solvers faster.

---

## Method at a glance

- **Signals (44 total):** psychometrics + NLP spanning problem decomposition, constraint handling, debugging strategy, test design, collaboration cues, and code traceability.  
- **Core method:** *semantic chunking in RAG and staged/multi-step prompting* with **language-fairness calibration** (down-weights grammar noise; preserves idea quality).  
- **Guardrails:** **expert review of flags before roll-up**; mapped to **BARS** (Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales = ratings tied to observable behaviors).  
- **Decision layer:** constrained utility with reliability & fairness gates; outputs include confidence intervals and gate justifications.

---

## Science foundations (plain-English summary)

- **L2-aware scoring:** separates semantic content from form; grammar penalties shrink as L2 uncertainty rises.  
- **Cross-lingual fidelity:** Fréchet-style distance on multilingual embeddings to benchmark conceptual closeness.  
- **Optimal transport (W2) with code-switch mask:** neutral cost for common bilingual markers; stable Sinkhorn solver.  
- **DIF tests:** remove or adjust items that behave differently at the same ability across language groups.  
- **Reliability & calibration:** generalizability G, ECE/MCE, test–retest stability, bootstrap CIs, and red-team perturbations.

---

## What CTOs get

- **Language-fair scoring** that judges thinking, not accent.  
- **Explainable rubrics** tied to observable behaviors (BARS).  
- **Speed & accountability:** Time-to-Offer ≈ 9 days; day-one readiness (devices, access, first ticket); quarterly diagnostics with promotion signals L1–L4.
